# Tournament Simulations
This project evaluates the predictive power and efficiency of over 30 tournament formats by simulating match outcomes using Monte Carlo simulations. Various pairing systems (e.g., Burstein, Dutch, random) are applied across formats such as single/double elimination, Swiss-system, and ladder tournaments. To compare the resulting rankings to a ground truth (from double round-robin), we use statistical distance measures—Hellinger Distance, KL Divergence, Wasserstein Distance, and Chi-Square—to quantify similarity between ranking distributions. Key insights reveal that while round-robin is most accurate, Swiss and double-elimination formats offer viable, resource-efficient alternatives.
